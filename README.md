# Employee Attrition Analysis using SQL Server

## Objective
To explore employee demographic and job-related data using SQL to uncover trends in attrition, identify high-risk groups

## Description
This project uses a structured SQL analysis approach to investigate various factors influencing employee turnover. The dataset includes attributes such as education, city, joining year, payment tier, age, gender, bench history, and experience. Insights are extracted to help HR teams understand and address potential causes of attrition.

## Key Questions Answered
1. What is the distribution of educational qualifications among employees?
2. How does tenure (years of service) vary by city?
3. Is there a relationship between payment tier and domain experience?
4. What is the gender distribution and how does it relate to attrition?
5. Do patterns of benching correlate with employee exits?
6. How does age or experience group affect leaving behavior?
7. What is the average age/experience for those who left vs those who stayed?
8. How do city and payment tier together influence attrition?

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Inspection** – Reviewing the structure and content of employee data.
2. **Cleaning & Preparation** – Calculated years of service, handled missing/derived values.
3. **Exploratory SQL Analysis** – Answered HR-related questions using aggregate and conditional queries.
4. **Exported Results** – Aggregated SQL results into Excel for visualization.
5. **Dashboard Creation** – Created charts summarizing key findings (Excel-based).


## Key Insights
- Majority of employees hold Bachelor's degrees.
- Turnover is highest among junior and less experienced employees.
- Benched employees are more likely to leave.
- City and payment tier combined strongly influence exit rates.
- Female employees are fewer but show higher retention.
